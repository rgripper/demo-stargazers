# Stargazers

A simple [Obelisk](https://github.com/obeli-sk/obelisk) webhook endpoint and a workflow
that monitors GitHub repositories. Every step is persisted and replayed during crash recovery.

## Workflow Code Example - `star-added`

```rust
fn star_added(login: String, repo: String) -> Result<(), String> {
    // 1. Persist the user giving a star to the project.
    let description = db::user::add_star_get_description(&login, &repo)?;
    if description.is_none() {
        // 2. Fetch the account info from GitHub.
        let info = github::account::account_info(&login)?;
        // 3. Fetch the prompt from the database.
        let settings_json = db::llm::get_settings_json()?;
        // 4. Generate the user's description.
        let description = llm::respond(&info, &settings_json)?;
        // 5. Persist the generated description.
        db::user::update_user_description(&login, &description)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Here is the complete [workflow source](./workflow/stargazers/workflow-rs/src/lib.rs) and the
[WIT file](./workflow/stargazers/wit/stargazers_workflow/workflow.wit) describing the interface.

## Setting up

### Setting up the external services
The activities require folowing values to be present as environment variables:
```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN="..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export TURSO_TOKEN="..."
export GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="some-secret"
export TURSO_LOCATION="[yourdb].turso.io"
```

#### Turso activity
This activity is responsible for persistence of users and their generated descriptions.

Follow the prerequisites section of the [activity-db-turso README](./activity/db/turso/README.md).

#### GitHub activity
This activity is used to find more information about the GitHub user who starred a configured repository.

Follow the prerequisites section of the [activity-github README](./activity/github/impl/README.md).

#### OpenAI activity
Generates description based on user's repositories and organizations.

Follow the prerequisites section of the [activity-llm-openai README](./activity/llm/openai/README.md).

Reimplementation in [JavaScript](./activity/llm/openai-js/) and [Go](./activity/llm/openai-go/) is available for comparison.

#### GitHub webhook endpoint
The webhook collects events sent by GitHub when a user stars one of the configured repositories, then triggers the workflow execution.

Follow the prerequisites section of the [webhook README](./webhook/webhook-rs/README.md).
Reimplementation in [JavaScript](./webhook/webhook-js/) is available for comparison.

#### Workflow
[Workflow](./workflow/stargazers/workflow-rs/) orchestrates all the activities, is triggered by the webhook.

Reimplementation in [JavaScript](./workflow/stargazers/workflow-js/) is available for comparison.

### Running

Set up the environment:
If [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) and [Nix](https://nixos.org/) are available:
```sh
cp .envrc-example .envrc
direnv allow
```
Otherwise install the following:
* [Obelisk](https://github.com/obeli-sk/obelisk)
* Optionally [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) for building the WASM components locally, version and other components are specified in [rust-toolchain.toml](./rust-toolchain.toml)
* Optionally [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) for integration testing of activities
* Optionally [Cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) for exposing the webhook endpoint

The exact versions of dependencies used for development and testing are in [dev-deps.txt](./dev-deps.txt).

```sh
obelisk server run --config ./obelisk-oci.toml
```

The server will start downloading the WASM components from the Docker Hub. Wait for the following
lines in the process output:

```log
HTTP server `webhook_server` is listening on http://127.0.0.1:9090
HTTP server `webui` is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
Serving gRPC requests at 127.0.0.1:5005
Server is ready
```

The workflow can be started using the Web UI.
The webhook endpoint can be triggered using `curl` or by seting up the webhook
in a GitHub repo. See the [webhook documentation](webhook/README.md) for details
on how to set up GitHub and a https tunnel to the local instance.

### Building the WASM components locally
The configuration above downloads the WASM Components from the Docker Hub.
To build all the Rust components locally run
```sh
just rust
obelisk server run --config ./obelisk-local.toml
```

To build JavaScript components use
```sh
just js
```


Make sure to use tools and versions as specified in [dev-deps.txt](./dev-deps.txt).
